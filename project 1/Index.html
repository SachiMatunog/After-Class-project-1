        <h2>A Critique on the Borrowing of P.E uniform, ID, Texbooks, and other Materials During Class Level 1 Offense: No.13</h2>
        <p> According to the Handbook of Adventist Academy Cebu in the Philippines, under Level 1 offense number 15, page 49, that the borrowing of P.E. uniform, ID, textbooks, and other materials during class is prohibited and is subject to the penalization of three (3) demerits. While the rule provides benefits and protection to students, it neglects the reasons why they might benefit from borrowing textbooks and materials in the first place.</p> 
        <p>The rule has many strengths, notably its protection against stealing and identity fraud for students. An instance in which the rule would protect students' autonomy would be in which a Grade 12 student uses a Grade 11 student's identification card to exit the school early, given that Grade 11, on the specified day, were allowed early leave. Action would be taken; this would result in the Grade 12's student demerit, and the Grade 11 student will have their identification card returned. Another strength of the rule in the handbook is its encouragement of accountability for personal belongings, which reduces the risk of misuse, as exemplified in the hypothetical situation earlier. Students with accountability are also likely to come prepared with the necessary materials to class, avoiding situations in which a class activity is disrupted due to material unpreparedness.</p>
        <p>Despite its benefits, the rule may be too restrictive. It neglects situations in which borrowing is necessary, such as when a student may fail to participate in an important activity due to forgetting their materials. While the rule teaches accountability to students, in hindsight, it also conflicts with the school's core value of service: students cannot borrow nor lend their materials, potentially straining their peer-to-peer relationships.</p>

        <h3> Solutions:</h3>
        <p>- introduce a tiered payment system in which students pay for books and p.e. uniform based on their household financial situation.</p>
        <p>- introduce a secondhand drive system or event where students/alumni can donate books and p.e. uniform</p>
        <p>- extend already existing community work service (working students) to help pay for books and p.e. uniform.</p>
        <h3> Weaknesses:</h3>
        <p>- adds pressure to students who are financially disadvantaged instead of supporting them.</p>
        <p>- conflicts with school's core values; promotes individualism over community.</p>
        <p>- strains peer relationships through possible isolation due to embarrassment of lacking resources.</p>
